# 🌾 Indian Agriculture and Rainfall Analysis (AI-based Q&A System)

## 📘 Project Overview
This project is an interactive Q&A system built using **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It answers user questions about **crop production** and **rainfall trends** in India.  
The system uses data from the **Ministry of Agriculture** and **IMD (Indian Meteorological Department)**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To help users get instant insights like:
- Average rainfall in a state  
- Top crops in a region  
- Yearly production trends  
- Comparison between crop and rainfall data  

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Streamlit**  
- **Pandas**  
- **Regex (for query understanding)**  

---

## 🧩 How It Works
1. User asks a question (e.g., “Average rainfall in Kerala”)
2. System understands keywords using simple NLP logic  
3. Correct dataset (rainfall or crop) is selected  
4. Data is filtered and processed  
5. Final answer is displayed with source reference
